Hi This is Rohit Kundu, a enthusiastic & passionate developer who likes to keep on experiemnting in canvas wheather it's computer or life.

This quiz is just the implementation of a sudden idea clicked in my mind on a bouring Saturday morning.

Note: As this application is built via pyinstaller ,so it packed everything in single file, making it large (approx 950 MB), so it will take time to launch, so plz hang-on, wait time may be 5-15 Minute based on your PC capability.

Please read the Manual pdf before using..it will give you a clear understanding on how to use and configure & customize in need.
Don't delete the 4 images & the mp3 file located in the directory as deleting these may halt the application..so keep those as it's. If you wanna change those replace with files with same names only.
If there is no progree.json, the app will automatically start as fresh (will not show load previous progress option).

I have build it for the use of Quiz competetion hosting in my city . But i'm uploading it so that anyone can view and have an idea and can take it forward.

Regards,
Rohit
